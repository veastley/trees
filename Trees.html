style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><p class="c2 c5"><span class="c10 c45"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c10 c45">TREES</span></p><p class="c2 c5"><span class="c10 c45"></span></p><h1 class="c24" id="h.er52ipf6lxdp"><span class="c10 c19">Prelude</span></h1><p class="c2 c5"><span class="c10 c19"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c8">I will tell you a story as it was told to me. &nbsp;When we are baptized and promise to be Christ&rsquo;s children, he promises that we can follow him to heaven and be part of his family. &nbsp;A two-way promise between two people is called a covenant. &nbsp;These promises between us and Christ, that we will follow after Him in his path, are called the Covenant of Christ.</span></p><p class="c2 c5"><span class="c8"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c8">God chose a family on the earth who would remember this story, so that each new generation of the family would learn the story and tell it to their children. &nbsp;They were supposed to tell all the other people in the world the story, so that all people could make the covenant and follow the path to heaven. &nbsp;A long time later the generation on earth who was supposed to tell the story was the family of a man named Jacob. &nbsp;Because God talked to Jacob face to face, God changed Jacob&rsquo;s name to Israel. &nbsp;Israel means he-saw-God. &nbsp;Israel&rsquo;s descendants were called the house of Israel. &nbsp;House just means family, so the house of Israel means the family of Israel. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2 c5"><span class="c8"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c8">After many years the family of Israel started being wicked. &nbsp;God sent a servant who was called Zenos to tell the family of Israel a new story about what the Lord was going to do. &nbsp;Zenos said that the family of Israel was like an old tree which was slowly dying. &nbsp;This old tree was in an orchard along with other trees. &nbsp;The orchard was also called a vineyard. &nbsp;The vineyard or orchard represented the whole earth, and the trees in the orchard or vineyard were the families on the earth. &nbsp;Zenos said that the Lord was going to save the few good branches from the dying tree, and then the Lord would destroy the rest of the tree. &nbsp;Christ was going to plant the good branches in far away parts of the vineyard, because Christ hoped that those branches would grow into new trees that had good fruit. &nbsp;Good fruit meant people that made the promise called the Covenant of Christ to become part of Christ&rsquo;s family in heaven.</span></p><p class="c2 c5"><span class="c8"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c8">Zenos said that four good branches from the tree of Israel would be hidden far away. &nbsp;So the Lord planted two branches where it was hard to live, one branch where it was good to live, and one where it was in between. &nbsp;A long time passed. &nbsp;Then the Lord and his servant went to see how the new trees were doing. &nbsp;All the hidden branches had grown into trees with fruit on them, that is people who made the Covenant of Christ promises. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2 c5"><span class="c8"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c8">A long time passed again. &nbsp;Then the Lord and his servant came again to look at the trees that had grown from the good branches. &nbsp;The first two trees that had been planted where it was hard to live were both still there, but they both had only bad fruit. &nbsp;The third tree was gone. &nbsp;That tree had disappeared into the trees around it. &nbsp;The fourth tree, that was planted where it was good to live, was still there except half of the tree had died, and the part that was left had only bad fruit.</span></p><p class="c2 c5"><span class="c8"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c8">The Lord was sad that there was no more good fruit on the trees. &nbsp;God had long ago made promises to their first father who was named Israel, and to Israel&rsquo;s father who called Isaac, and to Israel&rsquo;s grandfather who was called Abraham. &nbsp;When God first planted those branches, he had hoped that he could use those branches to keep the promises he had made to Israel and to Isaac and to Abraham. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2 c5"><span class="c8"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c8">Then the Lord tried a new way to help all the trees, that is all the families on earth, to have good fruit again. &nbsp;The Lord took cuttings from the three remaining natural trees and took cuttings from the Abraham trees and grafted those cuttings back and forth between all the trees in the vineyard. &nbsp;This invigorated all the trees to grow new good fruit, that is good people who promised to keep the Covenant of Christ. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2 c5"><span class="c8"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c8">The Lord sent his servant to the earth to get more servants to help. &nbsp; The servants taught all those families the old story about promising to keep the Covenant of Christ. &nbsp;Then the Lord &nbsp;Jesus Christ himself came down to work on the trees, but the families on the earth couldn&rsquo;t see Him working. &nbsp;The three trees that had been part of the first tree, and were hidden in the farthest part of the earth, were still there. &nbsp;Even though the old tree of Israel had been destroyed, there were still small remnants of that old tree mixed in with all the descendants of Abraham, Israel&rsquo;s grandfather. &nbsp;The descendants of Abraham who had a little of the old tree of Israel mixed in were called gentiles, and those gentiles were mixed in with the other trees or people all over the world. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2 c5"><span class="c8"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c8">The Lord slowly cut out all the bad branches on all the trees, that is branches that had bitter fruit. &nbsp;Finally all the trees were healed. &nbsp;All the families had good fruit. &nbsp;The promises made to Abraham and to Isaac and to Israel had come true. &nbsp;Christ had a harvest of good people who made the Covenant of Christ and became part of Christ&rsquo;s family in heaven. &nbsp;</span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><h1 class="c18" id="h.q90jpn548sjn"><span class="c10 c19"></span></h1><h1 class="c24"

class="c8"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c8">Some external links are simple clarifications with maps, historical accounts, etc., to provide context without ballooning the size of this paper.

many to demonstrate that I have a basis for a statement or conclusion.</span></p><p class="c2 c5"><span class="c8"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c8">For linguistic, historical, or archeological sources, I have dug into arcane papers published over the years in academic journals. &nbsp;Likewise I have searched in niche scientific magazines; those articles are generally simplified versions of academic papers. &nbsp;I have tried to provide web links to access these papers. &nbsp;An amazing wealth of academic research is now directly available online. &nbsp;A common pattern for these academic sources is to verify you&rsquo;re human and then suggest you buy a paid subscription. &nbsp;The actual paper is often in a PDF which might be online if the PDF is short. &nbsp;Otherwise there will be a download button to download the large PDF. &nbsp;PDF&rsquo;s are usually in a photocopy format which means you can&rsquo;t directly search their text. &nbsp;In such cases I try to provide the necessary page numbers within the microfilm which was later digitized into a PDF. &nbsp;More recent papers are digitized directly without a microfilm in the middle.

&nbsp;Unfortunately Jeanson does not accept the Book of Mormon, so his current research attempts to understand the connection of Central and South America to Asia using almost solely genetics. &nbsp;</span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><h1 class="c18" id="h.g0co1wornbf"><span class="c10 c19"></span></h1><h1 class="c24" id="h.na85erc7hids"><span class="c10 c19">Three Different Perspectives</span></h1><p class="c2 c5"><span class="c10 c19"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c11">I have three primary study tools. &nbsp;The first tool is </span><span class="c7">history</span><span class="c8">, especially new history coming to light in the last two hundred years. &nbsp;History is easy to grasp. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s just a lot of stories. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2 c5"><span class="c8"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c11">The second tool is the new understanding of </span><span class="c7">genetics</span><span class="c8">, that is the new findings commonly called DNA research. &nbsp;Genetics requires some teaching. &nbsp;DNA is how we copy our parents so that we look like our parents and how our children copy us so that they look like us. </span></p><p class="c2 c5"><span class="c8"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c8">The Y-chromosome lineage tracing which I will be mostly using is pretty simple. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c8">One part of DNA is called a Y-chromosome and it&rsquo;s only passed from father to son, not from mothers to sons or daughters. &nbsp;We can use this to see which families had the same fathers long ago. &nbsp;Every now and then one of the sons gets a small mistake in copying the Y-chromosome. &nbsp;Copying mistakes have been made over thousands of years since our father Noah. &nbsp;That means there are lots of different kinds of Y-chromosomes now. &nbsp;Scientists have arbitrarily named them by the letters in the alphabet, A to Z. &nbsp;The letters are just tags to keep track of different families. &nbsp;One of these Y-chromosome-tagged families got named with the letter Q, another with C, and another with R, and others with other letters. &nbsp;The families represented by the different letters are called haplogroups.</span></p><p class="c2 c5"><span class="c8"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c8">DNA inheritance which comes only from the mother is called mitochondrial DNA or mtDNA. &nbsp;mtDNA is also classified into haplogroups by capital letter similar to Y-chromosome DNA. &nbsp;There is no connection between the two different labeling systems. &nbsp;Be careful to check which kind of haplogroup labeling you&rsquo;re looking at if you&rsquo;re on the internet.</span></p><p class="c2 c5"><span class="c8"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c11">The last tool I will use will be the study of </span><span class="c7">linguistics</span><span class="c8">. &nbsp;Modern comparative linguistics is a powerful tool. &nbsp;Comparing linguistics means comparing languages to discover common historical roots. &nbsp;Linguists are very good at this. &nbsp;The problem comes when two languages collide and form a new blend called a creole. &nbsp;Historical creoles are difficult to trace, especially when more than two languages are involved or when the historical background is poorly understood. &nbsp;</span></p><hr

c26"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c8">Rather than looking at haplogroups of a specific gene, this 7 1/2 pound book combines the population variations of 82 different genes using a complex statistical summary called principal component analysis. &nbsp;The first principal component summarizes 27% of gene variation, the second principal component summarizes 16% of gene variation, and so on through a seventh principal component. &nbsp;The first principal component is segregated into 8 different numeric ranges. &nbsp;A geographic map can then be shaded in with eight different patterns of cross hatching representing the ranges, resulting in a geographic map of genetic variation which is simple and intuitive. &nbsp;The same thing is done with the second principal component, resulting in a differently crosshatched map of 8 ranges, and so on through the seventh principal component. &nbsp;This is called PC (principal component) mapping. &nbsp;</span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><p class="c2 c5"><span class="c8"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c11">One way to think of the PC </span><span class="c7">maps descending from first to second</span><span class="c11">, etc., is as </span><span class="c7">overlays with the top overlay hiding what is underneath</span><span class="c11">. &nbsp;As layers are removed, </span><span class="c7">each succeeding layer reveals a new set of more subtle influences in the map</span><span class="c11">. &nbsp;The </span><span class="c7">first overlay shows the big picture</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;in the current population. &nbsp;</span><span class="c7">The native </span><span class="c7">Americas</span><span class="c7">&nbsp;first component PC map (page 338 figure 6.13.1) shows gradations north to south, starting in the far north. &nbsp;The genetic picture from the lower 2/3 of the United States all the way through South America is remarkably similar</span><span class="c8">. &nbsp;These gradations aren&rsquo;t distinct. &nbsp;They just slowly blend and change from north to south. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2 c5"><span

class="c7">large-scale ancient copper mining and smelting in present-day north Michigan on Lake Superior</span><span class="c11">. &nbsp;There were also deeply worn ancient foot trails east from there to the Atlantic coast. &nbsp;Now look at ancient Egypt and Greece. &nbsp;The Egyptians in particular used a great deal of copper, far more than the limited Mediterranean-vicinity copper mines could have provided. &nbsp;The </span><span class="c7">Egyptians</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;reported that they </span><span class="c7">got</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;the bulk of </span><span class="c7">their copper from Phoenician ships</span><span class="c11">. &nbsp;When one of these copper merchants visited, it was three years (Mertz p. 54) before the same sailors would be seen again. &nbsp;Mertz&rsquo;s hypothesis was that the </span><span class="c7">copper was coming from Isle Royale and Keweenaw Peninsula in Michigan</span><span class="c8">. &nbsp;This was the only copper in the world that matched the purity level found in Egypt and Greece. &nbsp;Mertz says the Phoenician copper shipping into Egypt abruptly stopped in 800 BC. &nbsp;Mertz&rsquo;s date for the cessation of copper coming to Egypt is likely earlier than reality like most dates.</span></p><p class="c2 c5"><span class="c8"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c11">As further background information,

class="c11">Let&rsquo;s look further. &nbsp;The </span><span class="c7">Orkney Islands north of Scotland</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;were settled by the Norse about 800 AD. &nbsp;Today there is still a significant presence of </span><span class="c7">haplogroup X</span><span class="c11">, suggesting an earlier population had been absorbed by the Norse. &nbsp;The Orkneys would have been a major </span><span class="c7">wintering and re-fitting point on a Phoenician route between Europe and America</span><span class="c8">, the last outpost before the dangerous voyage to Newfoundland. &nbsp;This mtDNA haplogroup X fits perfectly with Mertz&rsquo;s Phoenician copper shipping. &nbsp;Another interesting fact: &nbsp;There is one other tiny but significant cluster of haplogroup X, in central Italy of all places. &nbsp;When Rome finally destroyed Carthage, the Roman soldiers were each given a benefit package upon being mustered out of service: &nbsp;They got to take a Carthaginian bride home. &nbsp;Suddenly the appearance of this unusual mtDNA (passed through the female side) genetic type in Italy makes sense.</span></p><p class="c2 c5"><span class="c8"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c11">This route through the </span><span class="c7">Orkneys and Greenland may have been the route taken by Nephi in steering his ship</span><span class="c11">. &nbsp;Likewise the </span><span class="c7">Mulochites</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;who later merged with the Nephites may well have come </span><span class="c7">aboard a Phoenician ship</span><span class="c11">.

in both Semitic and </span><span class="c7 c15">Egyptic</span><span class="c10 c7">. &nbsp;Thus Abram was given the new name Av Ra Ham, meaning &ldquo;father who sees his righteous seed.&rdquo; &nbsp;This matches Abinadi&rsquo;s teaching that Christ would see his seed. &nbsp;Abraham&rsquo;s new name makes sense because Abraham was a mortal type of Christ having promised seed.</span></p><p class="c2 c5"><span class="c10 c7"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c11 c15">When the flood receded another mother of the same lineage, </span><span class="c7 c15">Egyptus the daughter of Ham, settled her sons in Egypt</span><span class="c11 c15">. &nbsp;Their father&rsquo;s name was Mizraim and the Egyptians were known by the name Mizraim in the Hebrew Scriptures. &nbsp;</span><span class="c10 c7">The land was still covered with water but the tops of the sacred pyramids were visible, and she laid claim, still hoping for the same birthright as was her grandmother when Ham was given a name.</span></p><p class="c2 c5"><span class="c10 c7"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c8">Just before the captivity of Israel by Babylon, at the same time Lehi&rsquo;s family was journeying south toward the Yemen coast, some Jews escaped to Egypt and established a community on the upper Nile. &nbsp;Their descendants&rsquo; lineage was mixed into the surrounding Hamitic families. &nbsp;Likewise Arab traders not only brought the curse of slavery to Africa, but also the blood of Abraham and also Judah. &nbsp;Thus the Africans are also gentiles leavened with the blood and promises of Israel.</span></p><p class="c2 c5"><span class="c8"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c11 c15">Naming her son Ham was Ham&rsquo;s mother&rsquo;s hope and prayer to God. &nbsp;</span><span class="c7 c15">Ham did not receive the birthright, but the mother&rsquo;s prayer left on his descendants remains. &nbsp;Today the seed of Ham in Africa and around the world are often receiving the gospel message with joy. &nbsp;They are humble and only need to be taught. &nbsp;Zenos taught that the only thing that matters in the end is the fruit rather than the lineage.</span><span class="c11 c15">&nbsp;

He gave new scientific names to plants (6700 plants) and fish in both America and Europe. &nbsp;While collecting specimens on a trip west in 1820 he borrowed from a botanist named Dr. Ward some Native American artifacts in the form of a </span><span class="c7">series of pieces of wood which were joined together. &nbsp;Each piece of wood displayed painted pictographs, so the pieces of wood in sequence told a story in some kind of hieroglyphics</span><span class="c11">. &nbsp; Rafinesque copied the pictographs in sequence from the wood pieces, but had no idea of their meaning. &nbsp;In 1825 or 1826 he left Lexington to reside in Philadelphia. &nbsp;Between then and1833 he made &ldquo;a deep study of the Lenape&rdquo; which &ldquo;enabled me to translate them.&rdquo; &nbsp;In 1833 he wrote down a translation into English plus a rough translation into the current Delaware being spoken by Lenape descendants. &nbsp;In 1836 he published a book entitled </span><span class="c11 c17">The American Nations</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;which included only the English translation plus a few words of the Delaware equivalent interspersed, without the actual pictograph sources (printing other than typeset characters was too expensive). &nbsp;All this is laid out with details in Voegelin&rsquo;s 1954 study in the section named </span><span class="c11 c17">History of the Walam Olum Manuscript and Painted Records</span><span class="c8">&nbsp;on pages 243 through 272.</span></p><p class="c2 c5"><span class="c8"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c11">When Rafinesque died in 1840, his friends saved some of his papers from the public dump. &nbsp;In 1885 an ethnologist named Daniel G. Brinton received the old materials and made a new translation of the pictographs. &nbsp;The pictographs, Rafinesque&rsquo;s Delaware text, and Brinton&rsquo;s translation were all included in Brinton&rsquo;s book </span><span class="c11 c17">The Lenape and Their Legends</span><span class="c8">. A reprint made in 2022 is available on Amazon.</span></p><p class="c2 c5"><span class="c8"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c11">In 1933 Dr. C. F. Voegelin, who was more a linguist than an archeologist, received a </span><span class="c7">fellowship at Yale to work on a new translation. &nbsp;The final outcome of this was published in 1954 as &ldquo;The Walam Olum: &nbsp;The Migration Legend of the Lenni Lenape or Delaware Indians.&rdquo;</span><span class="c8">&nbsp; This translation &ldquo;smoothed out many of the obscure passages in the translation by Brinton.&rdquo; &nbsp;Also included was additional information, including a history of the manuscript, outside archeological considerations, and additional references. &nbsp;This oversize book is the gold standard translation of the pictographs, but it is out of print and extremely expensive. &nbsp;It was widely distributed to university libraries, and can still be accessed that way. &nbsp;Dr. (PhD UCBerkeley) Voegelin was a preeminent authority on the anthropology and linguistics of North American native Americans. &nbsp;Voegelin was president of the Linguistic Society of America when the Walam Olum was published by the Indiana Historical Society in 1954. &nbsp;He was an expert in the Shawnee (Delaware dialect) language. &nbsp;From 1967 to 1976 he was Distinguished Professor of Anthropology and of Linguistics at Indiana University.</span></p><p class="c2 c5"><span class="c8"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c10 c7">Each verse/pictograph of the Walam Olum has its own page in Voegelin&rsquo;s translation. &nbsp;A photographic reproduction of that verse from Rafinesque&rsquo;s 1833 unpublished portfolio (including pictograph, the spoken Delaware, and the English) is at the top of each of Voegelin&rsquo;s pages. &nbsp;Below that is Voegelin&rsquo;s English translation of the pictograph. &nbsp;Below that on each page is a meticulously updated correction of the spoken Delaware in Rafinesque&rsquo;s portfolio, with input from native speakers. &nbsp;Below that on each page is a footnoted description of the different symbols which combine to make that pictograph, plus addition information about related tribal pictographs relating to the Walam Olum.</span></p><p class="c2 c5"><span class="c10 c7"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c11">At the bottom of each page of the translation is a description of the pictograph, breaking it down into the pictograph&rsquo;s components which are standard symbols. &nbsp;</span><span class="c7">Each symbol is footnoted with a reference to a concordance of 81 symbols which are internally consistent and reappear within the pictographs. &nbsp;The pictographs are composed of combinations of these 81 symbols</span><span class="c8">. &nbsp;The concordance of symbols is located at the end of the entire translation. &nbsp;I will list a sampling from the concordance.</span></p><p class="c2 c5"><span class="c8"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c11">The symbol definitions in the concordance include references. &nbsp;Over 50 different reference sources are listed. &nbsp;A few reference samples are: &nbsp;</span><span class="c11 c17">Chinese characters, Their Origin, Etymology, History, Classification and Significance</span><span class="c11">, authored by Leon Wieger and translated into English and published in 1927, and </span><span class="c11 c17">Analysis of Chinese Characters</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;by George Durand Wilder 1922, numerous references on Indian sign language, and </span><span class="c11 c17">Comparison of Eskimo Pictographs With Those of Other American Aborigines</span><span class="c8">, in Transactions of the Anthropological Society of Washington, D.C., II (1883), 128-46.</span></p><p class="c2 c5"><span class="c8"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c11">The following is an extract or sampling of some of the symbols in the concordance. &nbsp;</span><span class="c10 c7">Since the Walam Olum told the story of a people originating in Siberia north of China, the sometimes similarity to archaic Chinese symbols is important. &nbsp;Most of the symbols do not correspond to archaic Chinese symbols;

The present-day Oklahoma Delaware dialect, he believes, is a &lsquo;leveled&rsquo; dialect, that is fairly homogeneous and probably of no great historical value.&rdquo; &nbsp;Oestreicher&rsquo;s primary Oklahoma native speaker said that the Lenape in Rafinesque&rsquo;s translation was poor Lenape and included English idioms. &nbsp;Then Oestreicher, one year out of graduate school, pronounces &ldquo;The hieroglyphs of the Walam Olum are hybrids concocted from ancient Egyptian writing, ancient Chinese Ku-Wen scrip, Ojibwa Midewiwin pictographs, and even some Maya symbols.&rdquo; &nbsp;These specific questions were addressed and discussed in Voegelin&rsquo;s study, but never in this article does Oestreicher mention the existence of the earlier book. &nbsp;Oestreicher said that by looking at </span><span class="c4"><a class="c9" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://diglib.amphilsoc.org/solr-search/content?search_api_fulltext%3Drafinesque&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1746639358391059&amp;usg=AOvVaw0P4LF4znmjKT865ieqz8rQ">Rafinesque&rsquo;s personal papers</a></span><span class="c11">&nbsp;in the archives of the American Philosophical Society in Philadelphia</span><span class="c11">, </span><span class="c8">he was able to &ldquo;pin down nearly all of his original sources.&rdquo; &nbsp;Oestreicher continues &ldquo;But why did Rafinesque create this elaborate hoax? &nbsp;The answer, I believe, lay not only in his desire for wealth and fame but also in his passionately held conviction that Indians came to North America from the old world.&rdquo; &nbsp;So Oestreicher in the article moved straight from an inspection of some of Rafinesque&rsquo;s varied interests to a psychoanalysis of Rafinesque to an absolute statement that the Walam Olum was now a proven hoax to further commentary based on the &ldquo;fact&rdquo; that he had proven a hoax.</span></p><p class="c2 c5"><span class="c8"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c11">Oestreicher referred to Rafinesque&rsquo;s &ldquo;desire for wealth and fame.&rdquo; &nbsp;Here&rsquo;s the actual sad ending of Rafinesque&rsquo;s life from page 244 of Voegelin&rsquo;s study: &nbsp;&ldquo;He brought out during his last four years a considerable amount of privately printed material, among which were </span><span class="c11 c17">The American Nations</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;and a </span><span class="c11 c17">A Life of Travels</span><span class="c8">, both published in 1836. &nbsp;The sales of these and other Items brought little or no return; and his estate did not provide funds for a decent burial.&rdquo; &nbsp;Rafinesque died of stomach and liver cancer in 1840. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2 c5"><span class="c8"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c11">Later there followed a second published magazine article. &nbsp;With no author&rsquo;s name shown and no date on the page, the following appeared in </span><span class="c4 c17"><a class="c9" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://archive.archaeology.org/online/features/hoaxes/walam_olum.html&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1746639358392331&amp;usg=AOvVaw3O_BCACSNhs2H2dWo9RC43">Archaeology Magazine</a></span><span class="c8">. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2 c5"><span class="c8"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c11">Clicking &ldquo;online features&rdquo; in the upper right of the article takes one to a 2011 web page, so apparently the &ldquo;online features&rdquo; html was hardcoded to a 2011 web page and the whole article was presumably created in 2011. &nbsp;The article refers to the 1954 publishing of a study and says &ldquo;</span><span class="c11 c15">But the study revealed how problematic the Walam Olum was, and some prominent archaeologists began rejecting it. Carbon dating, newly developed, further called it into question. Rafinesque&#39;s timeframe for the Bering Strait crossing, based on the legend, put it about 3,600 years ago, while carbon dating placed it at least 12,000 years ago. Still, many scholars took the Walam Olum as genuine, if historically inaccurate. While Stephen Williams in Fantastic Archaeology (1991) condemned it as a hoax, concluding the painted sticks and pictographs never existed, no definitive debunking appeared. It was up to David Oestreicher to reveal how and why Rafinesque concocted the Walam Olum. Oestreicher went to the right sources, Rafinesque&#39;s original papers and the Delaware themselves, and presented his results in his 1995 Rutgers University doctoral dissertation and in a popular article in </span><span class="c11 c15 c17">Natural History</span><span class="c11 c15">&nbsp;in 1996.&rdquo; &nbsp;&ldquo;Some prominent archaeologists&rdquo; would appear to include the academic who published this article without his authorship being shown. &nbsp;Scholars who didn&rsquo;t agree with Voegelin but were younger came up with a way to win: &nbsp;They waited until Voegelin and his fellows had been dead a few years, and then attacked. &nbsp;Did they feed research grist to a graduate student and let him break the story of a hoax? &nbsp;Funny how this obscure graduate student got instant celebrity treatment in a major periodical. &nbsp;The plug for Stephen Williams&rsquo; book &ldquo;Fantastic Archeology&rdquo; gives a clue as to who anonymously wrote this article. &nbsp;Stephen Williams taught a course at Harvard using his </span><span class="c11 c15 c17">Fantastic Archeology</span><span class="c8">&nbsp;book as the text. &nbsp;Williams is an excellent candidate for whoever ghost-wrote the 2011 article. &nbsp;Williams died in 2017.</span></p><p class="c2 c5"><span class="c8"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c11">The academic backstabbing wasn&rsquo;t quite over. &nbsp;In 1997 Oestreicher inadvertently blew the cover on alleged sexual misconduct by his former advisor. &nbsp;In retaliation the said advisor declared publicly that Oestreicher&rsquo;s dissertation was plagiarism. &nbsp;The advisor resigned but sued the university. &nbsp;Rutgers settled with the disgraced faculty member by paying him $92000 and restoring his pension. &nbsp;Oestreicher, in conjunction with two other previous graduate students, then sued Rutgers, saying he too was entitled to a payment. &nbsp;That legal action dragged on until 1917, when they lost a final appeal and got no money. &nbsp;Cross reference to Oestreicher&rsquo;s accusation that Rafinesque was motivated by desire for wealth when Rafinesque was destitute and dying in the 1830s. &nbsp;On the first page of chapter one of the dissertation, Oestreicher starts with a quote from Rafinesque&rsquo;s </span><span class="c11 c17">Life of Travels</span><span class="c8">. &nbsp;&ldquo;But time renders justice to all at last.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2 c5"><span class="c8"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c11">So what about Oestreicher&rsquo;s unpublished dissertation, which Wikipedia currently cites as absolute proof that the Walam Olum is a fraud? &nbsp;This exists only as an archived record </span><span class="c11 c15 c17">https://search.worldcat.org/title/1157613741</span><span class="c8">&nbsp;which can&rsquo;t be directly accessed on the internet. &nbsp;The dissertation can only be obtained via a library which is part of the worldcat.org system. &nbsp;A member library can request and receive a pdf file copy of the dissertation.</span></p><p class="c2 c5"><span class="c8"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c7 c15">The core of Oestreicher&rsquo;s dissertation argument is a demonstration that Rafinesque&rsquo;s Delaware language version of the Walam Olum was a translation from the English version (and not the English translated from the Delaware) and therefore a fraud. &nbsp;This is based on the assumption that Rafinesque said that the Delaware language transliteration text was the starting point. &nbsp;Rafinesque never said that. &nbsp;He only said he translated it. &nbsp;</span><span class="c8">On the preface page of his published version of the Walam Olum (part of American Nations, published in 1836), Rafinesque said that the wooden original was obtained &ldquo;in 1822 in Kentucky but was inexplicable till a deep study of the Lenape enable me to translate them with explanations.&rdquo; &nbsp;As Rafinesque explained elsewhere, the wooden original consisted of pictorial symbols painted on sticks and kept in order in bundles. &nbsp;The Lenape source which needed to be interpreted or translated was clearly the symbols on the sticks, rather than 1830s spoken Delaware. &nbsp;Oestreicher rejected the original pictographs as a fraudulent mishmash from various archaic sources. &nbsp; Oestreicher said that Rafinesque pretended to translate from Delaware language to English. &nbsp;Oestreicher&rsquo;s entire argument is based on the idea that Rafinesque pretended he translated from Delaware to English. &nbsp;But in fact the preface page on Rafinesque&rsquo;s published English version of the Walam Olum stated that Rafinesque translated from the wooden original, which consisted of painted pictographs on wood and not spoken Delaware. &nbsp;Rafinesque made no secret of how he created the crude translation into spoken Delaware: &nbsp;Rafinesque cited an early Delaware-English dictionary written by a missionary to the Indians named Heckewelder. &nbsp;In his unpublished portfolio Rafinesque displayed the material in three columns, the spoken Delaware, the English, and the symbolic original. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2 c5"><span class="c8"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c7 c15">Oestreicher actually made a significant contribution in showing that the Delaware transliteration in Rafinesque&rsquo;s original portfolio was derived from the English. &nbsp;Many academics who preceded him down through the years probably assumed the English was derived from the Delaware.</span><span class="c11 c15">&nbsp; However, what might have been erroneously assumed has nothing to do with what Rafinesque actually claimed. &nbsp;</span><span class="c7 c15">After establishing the interesting but irrelevant fact that the Delaware was translated from English, Oestreicher took up many pages demonstrating his expertise in spoken Delaware. &nbsp;He also demonstrated just what a poor Delaware rendition was created by Rafinesque, which had nothing to do with the authenticity or lack of authenticity of the wooden original</span><span class="c8">, and which Voegelin recognized and spent great effort bringing up to standard in 1954.</span></p><p class="c2 c5"><span class="c8"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c8">Oestreicher ties this together with the assumption that the pictographs were a fraud. &nbsp;An example of Oestreicher&rsquo;s logic is page 52 of the dissertation which states: &nbsp;&ldquo;The glyphs always conform with Rafinesque&rsquo;s English translation, or with his explanations of the glyphs in the American Nations, rather than the Delaware text. &nbsp;Had the pictographs been authentic, they would surely conform with the Delaware, and not with the English text.&rdquo; &nbsp;(Huh?) &nbsp;In a recapitulation of his proofs of fraud, Oestreicher says that &ldquo;The glyphs in the Walam Olum are not derived from any Delaware sources but mainly published Chinese, Egyptian, Ojibwa, Mayan, and other sources.&rdquo; &nbsp;For verification he cites other sources who say this is what they also think.</span></p><p class="c2 c5"><span class="c8"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c8">Another section of the dissertation addresses some material Rafinesque put together and sent to France in the 1830&rsquo;s in hope of winning an essay contest. &nbsp;Rafinesque was dying and out of money and the essay winner would receive a cash prize. &nbsp;Rafinesque didn&rsquo;t win, but Oestreicher included the material as a demonstration of Rafinesque&rsquo;s greed for money as a motivator for creating hoaxes.</span></p><p class="c2 c5"><span class="c8"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c8">The bulk of the dissertation is a rehash of a collage of theories of American anthropology and archeology from published scholarly works. &nbsp;Whether that would be called plagiarism as asserted by his former advisor is a matter of definitions. &nbsp;Ironically included are condemnations of Rafinesque for freely borrowing and restating material from published sources of his day. &nbsp;On page 250, Oestreicher asserts &ldquo;The flood legend presented in the Walam Olum is an eclectic composite of Rafinesque&rsquo;s sources.&rdquo; &nbsp;Another example of how this goes on and on is found on pages 74-75. &nbsp;Oestreicher cites Joseph Smith and the Book of Mormon as a fraud and moves on to say &ldquo;both documents may be viewed as sister creations.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c2 c5"><span class="c8"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c11 c15">At the end of Rafinesque&rsquo;s Walam Olum, in the 1836 </span><span class="c4 c17"><a class="c9" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.amazon.com/American-Nations-Outlines-General-Including/dp/1015503802&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1746639358399210&amp;usg=AOvVaw0EvNJIKncCcPfss21rmgT7">American Nations</a></span><span class="c8">, is a tiny piece he called a historical fragment. &nbsp;It purports to be a short history from the Indian point of view of American history from the late 1600&rsquo;s when William Penn founded Pennsylvania to the French and Indian War 1754-1764 to the Indians being forced to leave Pennsylvania in the 1820s. &nbsp;Since this fragment only exists as English text with no pictographs, it has no direct relevance to the historicity of the pictographs.</span></p><p class="c2 c5"><span class="c8"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c8">A section near the end of the dissertation passes judgement on previous studies and commentaries on the Walam Olum. &nbsp;Beginning on page 386 the dissertation addresses Voegelin&rsquo;s new translation and the research of Voegelin&rsquo;s associates. &nbsp;(Oestreicher always refers to them as The Lilly Team because the wealthy Eli Lilly spent years studying the background of the Walam Olum and likely was a major bankroller of the effort. &nbsp;Oestreicher paints a picture of them being paid shills. &nbsp;Since every university has paid staff constantly reaching out to wealthy donors, and since Oestreicher himself tried to sue Rutgers for money, this seems unbelievably hypocritical. &nbsp;Again cross reference to Rafinesque&rsquo;s failed attempt to win an essay prize being held up by Oestreicher as evidence of a Walam Olum fraud.) &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2 c5"><span class="c8"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c8">Page xiii of Voegelin&rsquo;s Introduction states &ldquo;As might be expected, the meanings of some of the pictographs are obvious, much like those of many primitive peoples, Chinese, Egyptians, Cretans, and Babylonians. &nbsp;Examples of these are the representations of the sun, moon, mountains, and the celestial arch. &nbsp;In several cases, however, it is rather astonishing to find symbols representing more or less abstract ideas such as &lsquo;chief,&rsquo; &lsquo;plural,&rsquo; &lsquo;peril,&rsquo; &lsquo;peace,&rsquo; and &lsquo;prosperity,&rsquo; closely resembling those of the archaic Chinese. &nbsp;These likenesses might lead one to suspect the Walam Olum to be a forgery made by someone familiar with ancient Chinese characters, were it not for the overwhelming evidence attesting to its authenticity brought together years ago by Brinton and the subsequent accumulation of supporting evidence.&rdquo; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2 c5"><span class="c8"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c8">On page 399 of the dissertation, Oestreicher includes the above Voegelin quote and says &ldquo;Rather than view the Walam Olum as fraudulent, however, Lilly seems to have opted for the idea that such corroborations were either coincidence or due to the universality of the human mind.&rdquo; &nbsp;Oestreicher again emphasizes the idea that Voegelin was a puppet of Lilly. &nbsp;If the Walam Olum people came from Asia north of China, is it reasonable to find common symbols between the two? &nbsp;Rafinesque was an expert on early American archeology and was well read in the old world literature, but I see no indication that Rafinesque knew anything about Chinese symbols. &nbsp;If Rafinesque was able to extensively research Chinese symbology in Philadelphia in 1830 (which is a stretch), he certainly produced an amazingly consistent use of Chinese symbols. &nbsp;Any intricate document which claims to be history must pass the test of internal consistency. &nbsp;The Walam Olum does so.</span></p><p class="c2 c5"><span class="c8"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c8">I feel compelled to add one final thought. &nbsp;Rafinesque had a porcupine personality. &nbsp;The reason he ended up unemployed in Philadelphia was that the university president at Transylvania University got tired of the personnel problem and fired Rafinesque. &nbsp;Rafinesque then wrote in his personal papers that his being fired would leave a curse on the school. &nbsp;He&rsquo;s now been dead for almost 200 years, but he&rsquo;s still alive and well on the other side and likely has the same disposition. &nbsp;Oestreicher libeled him. &nbsp;Oestreicher started his career with meteoric publicity and important connections. &nbsp;Then through bizarre events which were no fault of Oestreicher, his career crash-landed upon takeoff. &nbsp;I can&rsquo;t help but suspect that behind the scenes Rafinesque had a hand in that. &nbsp;</span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><p class="c2 c5"><span class="c10 c19"></span></p><h1 class="c24" id="h.fma46ayjgtbm"><span class="c10 c19">Appendix B: &nbsp;The Anthropology Religion</span></h1><p class="c2 c5"><span class="c10 c19"></span></p><h2 class="c2 c51" id="h.vl8umgn5f5xz"><span class="c10 c32">Junk Math</span></h2><p class="c2 c5"><span class="c10 c32"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c11">The first pillar of the anthropology religion is carbon-14 dating. &nbsp;For the last seventy years, </span><span class="c10 c7">archeologists have been using carbon-14 analysis to establish dates for plant, wood, human and animal remains. &nbsp;They pass it off as guaranteed and accurate science that can&rsquo;t be refuted.</span></p><p class="c2 c5"><span class="c10 c7"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c11">Carbon-14 is a mildly radioactive form of carbon which naturally occurs in the air and in living tissue. &nbsp;</span><span class="c7">The amount of carbon-14 indirectly depends on the strength of the magnetic field around the earth. &nbsp;The weaker the magnetic field, the more cosmic rays from the sun penetrate to the atmosphere, and the more carbon-14 is created.</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;

Going backward in time, about every thousand years further back the magnetic field would be significantly stronger. &nbsp;Each thousand years further back, the magnetic field would be still stronger. &nbsp;Of course the stair steps may be irregularly timed. &nbsp;The point is this: &nbsp;</span><span class="c7">If the current unforeseen drop in the magnetic field happened before over the millennia, the magnetic field would have been stronger and stronger the further back in time.</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;

copper plates with pictures of battles, elephants, etc. &nbsp;One researcher even found the Albany, New York, source of the rolled copper plates. &nbsp;The pictures all had a similar look, like the recognizable style of a cartoonist. &nbsp;Even Henrietta Mertz got taken in: &nbsp;Pictures in the back of her </span><span class="c4 c17"><a class="c9"

done. &nbsp;The writing is all done </span><span class="c11">in post-exilic</span><span class="c8">&nbsp;Hebrew. &nbsp;I don&rsquo;t buy it because the writing is not in the script that Hebrews used before being exiled to Babylon. &nbsp;The stones are written in Aramaic script, which is just Babylonian script. Is it possible some later Hebrews got over to Ohio? &nbsp;Yes, but I&rsquo;m a skeptic. &nbsp;I personally think the stones are an excellent forgery. &nbsp;</span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c10 c19"></span></p><h1 class="c51 c52" id="h.loun93rudakg"><span class="c10 c19">Appendix C: &nbsp;A PERSONAL NOTE</span></h1><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c10 c19"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c11">When Christ visited the Nephites, he told them he had other sheep to visit. &nbsp;Christ told the Nephites that the Jews in Palestine were never told about the Nephites because they never asked. &nbsp;Christ told the Nephites that he still had other sheep to visit. &nbsp;Oddly, the Nephites themselves then never seemed to ask for information about the other sheep. &nbsp;I am a curious person, so I accepted the Lord&rsquo;s invitation to ask about the other sheep. &nbsp;What followed, in parallel to endless research, was months of pondering all this in my mind. &nbsp;All that time I was studying different solutions to the Rubik&rsquo;s cube, while asking the Lord to enlighten my mind. &nbsp;The good news for which I am thankful is that the Lord answered my prayers with light. &nbsp;The difficult side is that my main connections to receiving guidance occurred between 2 and 4 AM, so my sleep has taken a big hit. &nbsp;Night after night I&rsquo;ve pondered and have received guidance line upon line and precept upon precept. &nbsp;Often the most important guidance was to throw away ideas which were incorrect</span><span class="c11">. &nbsp;</span><span class="c11 c17">I have arrived at a picture very different from what I had expected.</span><span class="c11">&nbsp; I can only take credit for any wrong conclusions or other mistakes</span><span class="c11">.</span><span class="c11">&nbsp; Someone else </span><span class="c8">gave me new ideas I hadn&rsquo;t thought of, and led me to unforeseen sources, so I can&rsquo;t take much overall credit except for the hard work.</span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c8"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c11">I was told to stop delaying and start writing this paper. &nbsp;</span><span class="c11">It</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;was impressed</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;</span><span class="c11">on me</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;that there was some urgency, that I couldn&rsquo;t delay finishing.</span><span class="c11">&nbsp; I</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;needed to get this completed by early May</span><span class="c11">, but w</span><span class="c8">hy the rush I do not know.</span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c8"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8">These are my own family roots: &nbsp;My wife&rsquo;s ancestors came from Germany, Poland, Sweden, and North Ireland. &nbsp;My father&rsquo;s people came from north England to Utah via the Martin handcart company. &nbsp;My mother&rsquo;s mother&rsquo;s people were Welsh coal miners whose wives heard the new message preached during their husbands&rsquo; 12 hour days in the mines. &nbsp;My mother&rsquo;s father&rsquo;s people were New Englanders who arrived with the first pilgrims and puritans. &nbsp;They joined the Mormon church in the early 1830&rsquo;s and donated gold to build the Kirtland temple. &nbsp;They were present in Nauvoo for that disaster; my great-great-grandmother died in her thirties and was buried there. &nbsp;I am the fifth generation from Nauvoo. &nbsp;This is a new day.</span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c8"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c11">I&rsquo;m sorry this paper is such difficult material. &nbsp;I know a lot of people will struggle to understand what I have written. &nbsp;I considered at different times writing three different papers coming from entirely different directions. &nbsp;One paper is this paper which I actually labored through. &nbsp;Another was a simplified summary with the supporting logic and references torn out. &nbsp;Another was a spiritually based story addressed to native Americans, in the spirit of the storytelling which is so fundamental to their culture. &nbsp;I </span><span class="c11">scrapped</span><span class="c8">&nbsp;the simplified version idea, because I didn&rsquo;t think anyone would simply accept the ideas without proofs. &nbsp;I have attempted to compensate by boldfacing key ideas. &nbsp;The storytelling version survives only in two fragments in the form of the prelude and postlude.</span></p><p class="c2 c5"><span class="c8"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c8">I first composed this in rich text format on an old Mac computer, and exported PDF drafts. &nbsp; Then my son Vern stepped in and showed me how the paper could be converted to Google Docs with additional features I badly needed, and how that in turn would allow me to export HTML and publish the paper on my own small and free web site. &nbsp;My web developer expertise is twenty years out of date, so that seemed miraculous.</span></p><p class="c2 c5"><span class="c8"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c11">Perhaps the importance of writing this is for my unborn posterity. &nbsp;Perhaps it&rsquo;s to appeal to someone who won&rsquo;t read and </span><span class="c11">ponder Covenant</span><span class="c8">&nbsp;of Christ because &ldquo;DNA has proven it to be false.&rdquo; &nbsp;Hopefully it will increase faith among those who are looking forward to receiving the record of all these hidden branches.</span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c8"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8">I turn 77 this May. &nbsp;If no one else reads this or cares, I at least hope that a hard copy will survive for some of my great grandchildren to read in the future. &nbsp;It will give them a glimpse of what was going on in my mind. &nbsp;Much more importantly, I hope this will give them some glimpse of what&rsquo;s in my heart.</span></p><p class="c2 c5"><span class="c8"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c11 c15 c53 c17 c44">Evan Lloyd Eastley</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c8">May, 2025</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c8">Provo, Utah</span></p><p class="c2 c5"><span class="c8"></span></p></body></html>
